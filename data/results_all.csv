Sie wollte Feedback zu dem Inhalt ihrer Schulung, da sie zwar als ehemalige Informatik-Studentin grundlegende Kenntnisse zu dem Thema hat, aber noch keine professionelle Erfahrung mit dem Thema hat. Da ich selbst als Informationssicherheitsbeauftrage, externe Prüferin von Cybersecurity und auch andere Berührungspunkte mit dem Thema in der Berufswelt hatte, hat sie mich gefragt.
Das Gespräch hat etwas länger gedauert (1-2h?), da es mehrere Diskussionspunkte gab:
- Es soll nur eine Schulung stattfinden (keine Folgetermine, also keine Vertiefung möglich)
- Hilfe zur Selbsthilfe, da Zeit nur für oberflächlichen Überblick reicht
- Problem mit Überladung/Überforderung
- Themen möglichst einfach, aber möglichst korrekt vermitteln
- Andererseits Distanz wahren (Pflicht zur eigenen Recherche vermitteln und nicht die Verantwortung übernehmen, wenn jemand den Passwortmanager ohne Backup konfiguriert)

Am längsten war die Diskussion zur Passwortgenerierung. Meine Freundin möchte während der Schulung immer wieder Fragen ans Publikum stellen, um das Interesse zu wecken und die Anwendung zu verstehen.
Ihre geplante Frage zielte darauf ab, dass verwendete Passwörter auf haveibeenpwned eingegeben werden sollen, um herauszufinden, wie sicher dieses ist.
Aus meiner Sicht würde ich davon abraten, auch wenn diese Webseite eher vertrauenswürdig ist (was man aber natürlich auch hinterfragen könnte). Jedoch geht es um den Aspekt, dass man Personen davon abbringen sollte, ihre Passwörter auf jeglichen Webseiten einzugeben, die nicht der originalen Webseite für den Login (z. B. Facebook-Passwort nur auf Facebook eingeben) entsprechen.

Er ist 31, ""Vollblut""-Informatiker seit über 15 Jahren, mit vielen eigenen Projekten, eher hardware-nah (möglichst kein Frontend).

Ich bin 30, war ebenfalls im IT-Bereich tätig, bin jedoch Psychologin (und hole nun meinen Master nach) und habe früher im HR alle Software-Abteilungen in einem Start-Up (100 Leute) begleitet und bin dann Richtung Projektmanagement.
Ich selbe entwickle nicht, habe aber ein *riesiges* Interesse an Software-Entwicklung, habe Software-Abteilungen begleitet (z.B. Refinements geleitet, in denen ich die Konzepte verstehen muss um gut moderieren können, z.B. wieso Singletons schrecklich sind, Race Conditions, Release Candidates, Breaking Changes, ...). Zudem habe ich eigene kleine Software-Projekte, die aber vernachlässigbar sind. (kleine Homepage, einen Urlaubsrechner, der in Excel zwar viel einfacher wär, aber zum Üben damals, ...).

Mein Mann und ich haben seit 2 Jahren eine Whatsapp-Gruppe zu zweit, in dem ich alles reinschreibe, was ich gerne besser verstehen möchte. Immer, wenn wir spazieren sind, zu zweit Essen gehen o.ä., picken wir uns dort Themen raus. Das können Themen wie Heap/Stack sein, wieso es so viele Linux Distros gibt, warum regex so komplex ist, etwas tiefer über Pointer (und Smart Pointer) sprechen usw. Es kommen so im Schnitt 1-2 Themen in die Gruppe (mal mehr, mal weniger) und es sind noch einige offen. Manche sind sehr umfassend, manche sehr präzise.

Wir waren also letztens (vor 2 Wochen?) im Zoo spazieren, das machen wir etwa 1x pro Woche, ich habe vorgeschlagen, ob wir uns ein Thema rauspicken und habe mich für Obfuscating vs. Encrypting entschieden. Der Auslöser war somit ""Interesse"" und ""Gewohnheit"", dass wir uns bei vielen Spaziergängen unterhalten.

We were approached several times by homeless or disadvantaged people begging for food or money.
We noticed one lady in particular who was being a little bit of a nuisance, by persistently asking, even though she was drinking from a McDonald's cup and eating a burger. She was in the vicinity for a couple of hours and we noted that she was given food or money several times. She appeared to be getting more and more intoxicated, as if there was alcohol in her cup.
We saw that there were many CCTV cameras located around the city square where we were and wondered why they hadn't alerted the police or security to this lady and several of her acquaintances.
We talked about what was the point and expense of all these cameras if they didn't help in keeping our public spaces clean and respectable?

It had come up a few times while she was listening to music on YouTube. I had to tell her to not download the app and click on nothing else. She didn't understand that it was an ad and nothing more than that. She kept saying: ''but it says I need to download this app it is on the screen''. People, like her, who don't understand the internet that well, are an easy ''prey'' or ''victim'' for criminals. They know that older people fall victim for scams like that.
