She wanted feedback on the content of her training course because, although she has a basic knowledge of the subject as a former computer science student, she does not yet have any professional experience in this area. Since I myself am an information security officer, an external cybersecurity auditor, and have had other contact with the subject in my professional life, she asked me for my opinion.
The conversation took a little longer than expected (1-2 hours?) because there were several points to discuss:
- Only one training course is to be held (no follow-up sessions, so no in-depth study is possible)
- Help for self-help, as there is only time for a superficial overview
- Problem with overload/overwhelm
- Convey topics as simply as possible, but as accurately as possible
- On the other hand, maintain distance (convey the obligation to do one's own research and not take responsibility if someone configures the password manager without a backup)

The longest discussion was about password generation. My girlfriend always likes to ask the audience questions during training sessions to spark interest and help them understand the application.
Her planned question was about entering passwords used on haveibeenpwned to find out how secure they are.
From my point of view, I would advise against this, even though this website is rather trustworthy (which, of course, could also be questioned). However, the point is that people should be discouraged from entering their passwords on any website that is not the original website for logging in (e.g., only enter your Facebook password on Facebook).",3,Friend,,Other,"Yes, somebody I know",Other (please specify),At home,"Personal experience (e.g. cybersecurity incident),Someone asked for advice",,"Application areas,Identity theft or fraud,Incidents,Phishing or scams,Privacy tools,Security behavior,Security tools",,5 (Strongly agree),"Interested/curious,Confident/informed,Helpful/responsible",,It was exciting to find out how the experiences overlap and how they differ.

On the one hand, it was about AI and whether AI really uses crime and generates crime. On the other hand, it was about what is real. Or what if the justice system and the police can no longer tell when something is generated by AI or not. Or if it leads to incitement and violence. Or how people use data on the internet and messages to create an identity. Or use another identity to commit a crime in that name. Or how an artificial identity is used to incite hatred. And what might already be possible today or in a few years. And that data security is becoming increasingly important. But data misuse could also become more and more common. Some people said that this is nonsense, that it's still full of bugs, etc., and that you couldn't generate something so perfect. The conversation then moved on to cyber warfare in politics and modern warfare without weapons—you would only have to hack a region's infrastructure to paralyze it (electricity, local transport, telecommunications, water supply, etc.). Oh, the conversation went on for several hours, probably 3-4 hours.
Another situation was at work, where the topic was password security for devices. Since most of them are located directly at the PC, or if it is a shared device or in the immediate vicinity, how secure are they if they are so easily chosen? How secure is our test data then? Can anyone access it? Should we only give the passwords to the person next to us? Without leaving a note nearby. How secure is the university against cyber attacks, etc.? Some were more concerned about security, while others were very confident, which led to a heated discussion about what-if scenarios.

He is 31, a “full-blooded” computer scientist for over 15 years, with many projects of his own, more hardware-oriented (preferably no front end).

I am 30, also worked in IT, but I am a psychologist (and am now getting my master's degree) and used to work in HR, supporting all software departments in a start-up (100 people), and then moved into project management.
I don't develop myself, but I have a *huge* interest in software development, have supported software departments (e.g., led refinements where I had to understand the concepts in order to moderate well, e.g., why singletons are terrible, race conditions, release candidates, breaking changes, ...). I also have my own small software projects, but they are negligible (a small homepage, a vacation calculator, which would be much easier in Excel, but it was good practice at the time, etc.).

My husband and I have had a WhatsApp group for two years now, where I write down everything I would like to understand better. Whenever we go for a walk, out to dinner, or something similar, we pick topics from there. These can be topics such as heap/stack, why there are so many Linux distros, why regex is so complex, talking in more depth about pointers (and smart pointers), etc. On average, 1-2 topics are added to the group (sometimes more, sometimes less) and there are still some open. Some are very comprehensive, some very precise.


So, we were walking in the zoo recently (two weeks ago?), which we do about once a week, and I suggested that we pick a topic and decided on obfuscating vs. encrypting. The trigger was therefore “interest” and “habit,” as we often talk during our walks. We talked about the topic for about 20-30 minutes and then moved on to quantum computers and then kernel development.",1,Other (please specify),Partner,Myself,No,"Public space (e.g., café, train)",,"Someone asked for advice,Other (please specify)",Neugierde,"Application areas,Identity theft or fraud,Security behavior,Other (please specify)",Verschlüsselung,4,"Interested/curious,Confident/informed,Other (please describe)","Taken seriously, valued, other people's interest in me","I really enjoy talking to my husband about software topics that I initiate (unless he has something from work, then that too).

And especially that this interest is not “forced” because of my love for him, but that I have had this interest for over 15 years (only I didn't have anyone to talk to about it before and chose a different career path).
