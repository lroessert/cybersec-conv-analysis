Why did you feel this way during the conversation?
----
Because I am affected myself and have little knowledge of the subject
----
I knew that it was either phishing or had ended up in the wrong mailbox, but I simply didn't know how to “remove” the email.
----
A tiresome topic that needs to be dealt with. You don't really know much about it, but you know it's important.
----
It was exciting to find out how the experiences overlap and how they differ. I was also able to provide helpful feedback.
----
I don't know much about it. The school isn't helpful, but they want the device.
----
Take a clear stance
----
Because of the problem and its connection to the (perceived) indifference of others.
----
Important topic, interesting topic
----
Because I want to be sure my data is safe.
----
I had already had several points of contact with it through my studies.
----
Cybersecurity, especially in the context of quantum computing is incredibly interesting in my opinion (the theory behind it). The reality of it is also quite scary however since a large, working quantum computer can break current key-encryption schemes much easier than conventional computers.
----
The feeling of being able to educate others and pass on information.
----
Because I think that no one is or can be 100% informed about data security.
In addition, it is worrying what modern technology might be capable of in the future. And who simply cannot keep up when it comes to the security of individuals.
----
I felt that way because I was responsible for the passwords.
----
Because I have knowledge in cybersecurity.
----
Because I never experienced before what a powerful cyber attack can do
----
I really enjoy talking to my husband about software topics that I initiate (unless he has something from work, then that too). He explains things very well and I'm always happy when he explains things to me, “even though” he sometimes has to break it down a lot, but I'm not “the annoying little woman who pretends to be interested but doesn't listen anyway.”
----
I have been working in the IT industry for about 40 years.
----
Since I have been dealing with this topic for quite some time
----
Because I trust my partner to keep themselves well informed about important issues and then share this information with me so that I can also benefit from it. It also seemed like a good idea in principle, which I just needed to put into practice.
----
because I was already tired from the day's work
----
It's a topic I thoroughly enjoy and interact with 
----
It's very interesting to know someone who is a cybersecurity genius and can share insider information.
----
It is an important problem, but many people do too little about it, or it is not important to them. There is too little education in society, too little knowledge.
----
Since I am well versed in this subject thanks to my studies.
----
Fear of the future
----
Good input from the colleagues. Straight way to go further from there point of the conversation
----
My partner studied computer science and is generally interested in technology. Accordingly, I trust his expertise.
----
Because the topic is very important in scope of my work.
----
Because it took me a long time to set up this two-factor authentication.
----
I’m don’t know that much about cyber security and computers in general
----
I know a lot/enough about the topic where I think people will benefit from my advice. 
----
Because it is really annoying to see people do something so wrong, but they have problems to change such behavior
----
Because it feels like it is something that in the future will not be able to have control over.
----
Scams are annoying. 
----
Because on this conversation i was the person that had most background about the subject.
----
I just then knew how little I knew
----
I was confident because I believed that it would be completely impossible to unlock it because the password was forgotten. I was curious to see how it would be done and the extent of the damage done (i.e. lost data, photos, etc.)
----
I was concerned about my data at both
----
Because I had some knowledge of the topic and felt I could give useful advice. I was also curious about the incident and wanted to help him avoid similar issues in the future.
----
Because I am confiden't in my skills.
----
Because I might have been affected by the event.
----
I knew what i was speaking out and felt confident in giving correct information
----
because anyone can have access online and they can scam you
----
I was worried about the data exposed and private information available to the attackers
----
I’m feel my privacy is being invaded and that made me feel uneasy 
----
It was an interesting subject. 
----
it made me think about the different crimes which can happen becuase of the the cyber security issues.
----
i did not know it was possible to host a password manager, so I was curious.
----
because i know it is nit easy for her to understand and remember all these details to be secure
----
I had first hand experience of the same issue
----
I felt like I was being reminded of things I had learned previously 
----
as it was an important topic, that needed to be discussed and explained
----
I feel like cyber security is a normal thing to be talked about on a person's first day if they spend a lot of time using a computer at work so I was expecting it and didn't hear anything new. 
----
I wanted to explain to the person that it is very dangerous
----
I just wanted access to the software and felt we had done the appropriate anonymisation procedures to do our analysis, just wanted to make sure we could do it.
----
This is because I previously thought that the process of trying to get into the MI6 would be more advanced and challenging.
----
Well It's not comfortable having your information used by companies and the government 
----
Because I was affraid of the cybersecurity 
----
For fear of losing money.
----
I felt helpful because I was saying this isnt new and unknown and scary, we are familiar with how it works.
----
Because of the insecurity it generates.
----
I believe that the course we decide on will help us with a more secure account 
----
I felt like I was able to spread awareness about cybersecurity from personal experiences from me in the past, and why we have to take certain steps to protect our data even if they can be a bit tedious 
----
Cybersecurity is a part of my work
----
Because I was worried about the future and things that could potentially happen to everyone, including me.
----
It is worrying how easily a cyber attack can happen and the impact it can have. 
----
I worked for one of the major banks for 35 years so have a lot of experience in that field
----
Because phishing might look easy to acknowledge, but those scams are getting better and better at fooling people and it is quite dangerous and concerning.
----
I had read the same article that he was talking about
----
I felt this way because on one hand I was worried about the security incident and on the other hand I was curious to find out why it happened and how will prevent this from happening again in the future.
----
I felt that I was giving helpful and important information. I felt worried that my father's email and other accounts would get hacked, as the password had been leaked in a data breach. I felt annoyed because I'd had this conversation with him multiple times before and he never listens to me and does what I suggest.
----
I felt that i was leaning useful stuff but also that it was hard to see all the places where a cyber attack could happen.  
----
Whilst it was helpful and made me feel more confident, I still felt indifferent as it’s not a very interesting topic 
----
I have a background in IT security topics, so I felt I was knowledgeable and could add something of my own. I was also interested in how the company plans to tackle phishing and what training is planned. I felt I could contribute something of value to the discussion.
----
We felt slightly annoyed and even a little intimidated.
----
Because the topic was relevant and I understood the basics well enough to explain some common risks. I wanted to share practical advice to help others avoid problems.
----
because I am interested in cybersecurity
----
Because I had already installed one and new what was going on.
----
Because I have a good knowledge of the area
----
Because I feel exploited
----
Happy conversation
----
I have every confidence in his ability to guide me and was curious about an experts view on what had occured
----
I was interested in knowing what had happened.
----
I find it interesting to learn more about certain things specially if it's also things people I care about like too.
----
i wanted to help my son stay safe online
----
It makes feel curious because I want to learn more and how I could potentially make a career in the field somehow.
----
Beacuse i read about this topic before
----
its always tense, no one wants to mess up but the phishing emails are really good sometimes
----
I know a good deal about passwords, changing passwords, and keeping an eye out for potential breaches.
----
I didn't understand that it could be a scam so when I found out it annoyed me and scared me.
----
I already have bad anxiety, so if anyone was after my device it made me feel more nervous. 
----
Cause I don't want a lock on my phone.
----
I felt worried/anxious simply because I feel like you can never be too safe with hiding your identification 
----
I work as a computer tech so i know a little bit about the topic since i like to read news about it from time to time even though im not a cybersecurity proffesional
----
I want him to be happy and do well in his career. 
----
I've never heard of anything like it happening so close to home. I also learned a lot from my coworker about my town. 
----
I was really curious on how people manage to steal complex currency like crypto.
----
If I am not being listened to, there is always a chance that my warnings will go unheard, and our data could be leaked against my will. It's stressful.
----
At the time, I had no issues with my work-related account. I paid attention to the conversation, chimed in when I had a question or contribution, and felt confident about the information given.
----
Because I get viruses on my last laptop and was worried it would be the same
----
I didn't know what information that we've had was leaked. So, I was curious to know what was it. Also, a bit worried because what passwords do I need to update. Also, it was good to be informed about the leakage.
----
gut
----
Because I know my fair share about cybersecurity
----
I like the topic
----
I felt concerned about my own accounts but very engaged in the conversation.
----
Personal experience with online security.
----
Annoyed after knowing my colleague have restrictions too
----
I do really try very hard not to get annoyed with people when they ask me questions, just sometimes I really want to move on from the conversation. Which is why I recommended a tool to the person, instead of offering to "check" or verify the file myself. This particular person regularly makes poor decisions regarding their digital security. I was actually happy to be able to recommend virus total to them though, it might help them to make wiser decisions about future downloads. So overall, I consider that a win. I don't mind helping direct family members, or household members with tech, but when it becomes constant with semi-distant friends it gets annoying. Like if the only time the person talks to me is when they have a computer problem, it just makes me annoyed.
----
I was worried that she would fall for the scam. I gave her advice about falling for scams like this.
----
I tried to put her mind at ease
----
I did not know that this kind of phishing may be used and that it still can work.
----
I felt worried because there's always a small chance one can fall for it.
----
Because it was a large sum of money and it was a relative of me who was scammed
----
Because it's a topic that is rarely discussed
----
because it's my friend and i wanted to help them
----
I was worried whether she could understand what I'm trying to tell her, and responsible, because I feel like I'm the most skilled person in that area in my family, so I think I'm the only one who can help her with cybersecurity.
----
Because I realized that I can teach someone and give very useful info
----
Ich arbeite in der IT und kenne mich berufsbedingt mit Sicherheitsrichtlinien aus, weshalb ich mir recht sicher bin, gute Tipps geben zu können.
----
I was worried that she had to pay something cause it was a real company the email came from but i talked to the canadian company and they said they had gotten the wrong email.
----
ASs Generative AI can be helpful in some cases it can also pose a threat as it goes to far
----
Uncertainty
----
I felt worried since my mother was deeply concerned about her safety.
----
is an interesting topic
----
It was an interesting topic about which I knew enough to start the converstation.
----
I am quite knowledgeable in this area through my work alone, so I informed myself and also felt helpful.
----
I was kind of sissapointed in my cousin - because she fall for a simple scam and worried about my mom because she is kind of old and do not understand scams so i had to protect her.
----
I am very interested in matters of cyber security and how to protect ourselves. I have also attended some seminars about detecting fraud and/or phising via e-mail. I am always interested in the "tricks" that are used on those ocasions.
----
Interested, because I wanted to know what my colleague had to say about it—and annoyed, because I prefer to use simple passwords. The topic is frustrating.
----
important topic
----
This topic is so scary, because I think whenever I will learn how thiefs are working they will find new way to scam me
----
because the subject interested me
----
Because apparently our data is getting used without our consent.
----
I have fallen victim to data fraud more than once
----
Unnecessery work due to not obey rules. 
----
Because the shutdown lasted for almost a day, which made everyone anxious. That's why remembering the incident causes me to feel that way 
----
I haven't really heard similar tests from other friends or relatives, so I was curious.
----
I feel like I have sufficient information to understand the threat and know how to mitigate it, but the constant cyberattacks make us vulnerable as a society.
----
its scary how fragile our data is
----
because I didn't know information about specifically happened and how I can help him.
----
Because it is a sensitive issue that we should all take into account because it can happen to us.
----
I wanted to give my advice to the person I talked to.
----
Because I have had similar incidents before and knew how I was going to handle the situation.
----
Because I think it is an important topic.
----
i trust my self
----
I think it's an interesting topic - I would like to learn more about it
----
Because she ended up agreeing with and understanding what I was saying and it made me feel better about her security online.
----
I knew enough to help him.
----
I feel that we have made significant improvements to our environment since the incident. The real trick now is to continue to use that energy to drive improvement proactively.
----
I knew what needed to be done and how the subject needed to be broached
----
A little worried about our card details and the future of a good store
----
It worried me that the hackers could have access to my personal information and I was annoyed that it had happened and how it would affect me but also interested in the details of what had occurred
----
Many of the issues discussed are the ones I have been aware of for a number of years. I felt my ideas and precautions were legitimate and supported by the IT leader. 
----
I was curious to know how much information AI was able to share about myself and concerned about how well it was able to interpret the searches I had made into an overall picture of myself. I was relieved that it seemed to know less about me than my partner!
----
She initially wasnt worried which made me angry and worried but gradually accepted 
----
Upsetting to see the rise in crime, how people behave, coarsening 
----
I felt annoyed that her account was hacked and it felt like we couldn't do much after the fact.
----
I was interested in discussing the topic and hearing my colleagues opinions 
----
it is useful to discuss topics that are important to participant safety
----
Although I could not directly assist the person who initially contacted us, I did provide a way in which the issue could be resolved.
----
Because its part of my job
----
Because I was just trying to help.
----
It was an interesting topic, but also because I remember I had recently watched a video on the topic which made me feel informed
----
Having experienced this before firsthand I wanted to help my brother out. 
----
I work at a university and i'd also seen an influencer post that she received one of the emails.
----
Annoyed by the situation it had put everyone in, worried about the longer term issues 
----
I wanted to learn more how this happened and was worried that someone targeted him
----
Because I can well imagine the pain it is to go through this.
----
I am more indifferent usually since hack, leaks and breaches are the status quo these day until it dawned on me that initial issue I called into the phone bank might be related to the massive data breach just reported in the news. Then I got agitated about it. 
----
I found it interesting to discuss this with my mother and find out what experiences she herself has had, even though she is not a digital native.
----
I made the comment that started the convo, that means I have a responsibility to the person to at least pretend I am interested if they engage. 
----
I knew what we needed to do
----
I felt I could provide some useful information to the other person.
----
The other person involved was an expert and I felt that listening to his advice could be very helpful. 
----
because my colleague was asking me a few simple questions, i had no reason to be hostile
----
I like to be informed about these things. It helps me to be more cautious and take preventative measures.   
----
The information was good and I felt glad to get updates. 
----
I know this is a difficult topic for older people. Not everyone understands it. I feel responsible for my parents online safety.
----
I have dealed with these things before
----
I felt like this couldn’t happen to me and to be more careful 
----
I was eager to learn about cyber security
----
because it was an important matter
----
It was an interesting topic that I had never encountered before
----
Because it is a very important topic that is not talked about enough among people
----
My friend is really passionate so he explained well the questions I had and made me feel secure that I should not worry that my data is secured
----
because he was informing us of some insues
----
Because is a situation that is both interesting (how did it start? could it be stopped? ...) and worrying, because it can happen to our company too
----
I do my research on a daily basis
----
I had taken several courses about this topic before, so I felt sure I could identify potential threats.
----
I understand the importance of cybersecurity but I'm also not that interested in it personally
----
I had researched the subject thoroughly.
----
I already knew about the dangers of phishing mails and spam.
----
Its an interesting topic to talk about, but it also complicated
----
Because in the face of cyber attacks like this, one feels helpless.
----
It's fascinating really.
----
because of my knowledge about technology of privacy
----
I felt I have good knowledge regarding these topics, but I'm always interested in learning more.
----
I was glad that my friends are curious in the same topics. I was interested about their opinions.
----
Because data security is a major issue and I don't think it's always guaranteed.
----
because it's a serious matter that affects all of us online
----
i was both curious about the scale of the phenomenon and worried about the vulnerability of sensitive data.
----
I remember when my mom bought something and it never came to her. It was just some scam website. 
----
it's useful to exchange informations and share experiences
----
Because I dont know much about it 
----
I felt like I'm informing others so they won't fell for this scam. I felt helpful and confident. 
----
I'm generally up to date when it comes to cybersecurity. I tend to be self-conscious and try to do my best to avoid dangerous situations. On the other hand, I don't underestimate the possibility that a cyber attack might occur against me as well. From my personal experience, I've noticed that even the most informed person can make stupid mistakes, because the techniques used are getting more and more sophisticated.
----
Worried, because my mom could easily fall victim for a similar scam
----
because my account was being hacked. 
----
Because it's a topic I've heard a lot about and I know something about it.
----
Because I understand about the content of the conversation.
----
Because my past issue was solved and I trust my knowledge in protecting myself.
----
Because I thought it could happen again
----
Because my partner bank account could have been compromised
----
AI is a real cybersecurity problem for us, because our work is important.
----
Why did you feel this way during the conversation?
----
AI is developing so quickly, and I feel like it's impossible to predict what will happen in five years or so.
----
It's too much for me. I don't know my way around and can't protect my disabled son there.
----
Because it felt good to act with foresight and plan responsibly.
----
Same answer as the previous one
----
I have the same Wi-Fi router and live in the same dormitory on the same floor.
----
As I was interested to learn.
----
I was curious about why this issue happened and also i decided to contact the company and informed them about the issue.
----
I was glad i can help
----
Because my data was stolen and probably sold 
----
It was among family and my knowledge on the subject is good.
----
I'm always worried to some extent how my data is being processed.
----
I wanted to get all the pertinent information. 
----
I found it interesting that this scam is so common and people are still falling for it. I'm also interested in the psychology of this tyoe of scam.
