Why do you think the other person felt this way during the conversation?
----
More knowledge about the subject
----
The other people had already “deleted” this type of email several times before.
----
another person wanted to help
----
For the same reasons as me
----
She is a school assistant and doesn't need to know anything about IT, but she has difficulties on site with my son with passwords, etc.
----
He was probably surprised that I didn't naively follow the majority.
----
On the one hand, due to the increased attention paid to the issue, and on the other hand, also because of the problems involved.
----
Problem known and classified as important
----
There is a belief that if you use smartphones, you have to accept this.
----
I don't know
----
We shared both the interest in the theory as well as the worries about the implications for cybersecurity. Additionally, my colleague knows a log about quantum computing given his research focus so he was more confident talking about the topic.
----
Topic discussed frequently; problems are always sought in others, poor self-awareness
----
Some were real tech pros or even employees at Telekom. Others have a side job for the German power grid. Others just felt safe and had no concerns. How do you think what will be regulated or something like that won't happen, that's science fiction...
----
Kennt sich besser aus 
----
Because you think I'm clumsy.
----
Because she accidentally has clicked on the link.
----
Because the attacked showed that we were not ready in any shape or form to protect our country from such threats
----
My husband is happy that I have a genuine interest, especially in contrast to our experiences with couples in our circle of friends. (Almost all of them are in STEM, and in the couples where only one partner is in STEM, the other partner completely blocks it (“omg, stay away from me with that IT stuff, I'm not interested in it at all”).
And especially that this interest is not “forced” because of my love for him, but that I have had this interest for over 15 years (only I didn't have anyone to talk to about it before and chose a different career path).

I am also very grateful for how well he explains things and how much I enjoy our quality time together.
----
Because the people who write these terrible applications don't think for a moment and just copy the same old procedure over and over again.
----
Not knowing what to do, when, and where
----
He presented verifiable information and was confident that he was making a good recommendation.
----
She seemed to know her way around.
----
They are a professional with a long career that involves handling such topics
----
He knows his way around.
----
I often annoy people with these topics, even IT nerds...
----
Because she did not know the mathematical basics, but subsequently understood them.
----
Works in the IT industry
----
We talk much about these kind of topics
----
Because the person has experience in the field of cybersecurity and because it is a personal issue.
----
My colleagues read a lot about such topics and are very well informed.
----
Because the other people also had problems logging in.
----
We have the same knowledge when it comes to cyber security
----
They did not see the importance.
----
My partner also doesn't want to explain to his parents how cyber security works, because it would be very strenuous.
----
Same reasons
----
It wasn't that interesting to him. 
----
We are in the same bachelor degree that is about cybersecurity and informations, they need it.
----
He was excited talking about it
----
He was worried that his tablet would not work and he would get behind in his schoolwork.
----
Heather doesn't use online so no data
----
He had just experienced a cyber incident and seemed concerned about how it happened. At the same time, he was eager to learn and asked for advice to prevent it from happening again.
----
As part of the job my supervisor was also confident in his skills.
----
Because they may have been affected too.
----
She asked me more and more questions
----
the same reason like me
----
He liked talking about his area of expertise
----
The other person shared the same concerns as myself regarding privacy invasion 
----
He behaved in this way. 
----
it was very involved discussion.
----
Because they were sharing their knowledge about something they like. 
----
because it is something outside of her sphere of interest
----
They were complaining about an onerous task
----
They were confident and informative 
----
as they needed to be on board with the actions needed to be taken
----
They work in IT and now tips and tricks to keep an online user as secure as possible 
----
because she was afraid of her data leaking
----
They are an expert in the field, and have always been helpful on this context.
----
This is because they were the one with the experience, and were simply recounting their steps in the procedure.
----
The same reason
----
She was also affraid 
----
Because she was an expert in cybersecurity.
----
I think they felt that way because they were feeling vulnerable and scared.
----
The same 
----
We both agree on it
----
They started to understand the importance of cybersecurity
----
We both work for IT department
----
For the same reason, and one friend of me had his passwords leaked, so he was also annoyed
----
He was keen to discuss this. 
----
My dad does usually ask my opinion about online payments as he trusts my experience 
----
Given that it was him that started the conversation, I think he wanted to share how worried he got.
----
They never usually bring up these type of conversations
----
My colleague doesn't have a lot of technical knowledge about cybersecurity. So, he was only worried about how fast we'll fix the issue.
----
They didn't seem particularly bothered or anxious about their password being in a data breach. They didn't seem to understand the possible ramifications. It was the same reaction I've had from him when discussing this topic before, and he's never gone on to do something about it on the previous occasions.
----
People were engaged on the course and joining in the conversation.  They were interested in the topic.
----
You could tell there had been issues with this that could threaten security for the business hence the anxiety for that individual but they felt helpful and responsible because they were leading on fixing this problem 
----
He was clearly involved and concerned that employees were still clicking on suspicious links. At the same time, he was keen to find a solution and improve awareness among the team, so I think he felt responsible for the situation and wanted to do something about it.
----
Because we couldn't enjoy our afternoon fully.
----
They work in tech and seemed engaged, sharing their own experiences and knowledge. The conversation was a good chance for both of us to bounce ideas and learn from each other.
----
because he is my friend and he is interested in the same topics as me
----
Because he wanted solutions
----
because she was starting the course she's very interested
----
Because that's what they seemed to feel
----
I was asked? "Really? I alawys do it"
----
Because he's good at his job
----
She explained herself with confidence.
----
He has a lot of knowledge on the topic so think whenever I ask him something about it, he always feels good about being able to help me.
----
he was worried about scams but wanted to learn more
----
She is a curious person as well and genuinely is interested in the things I'm interested in.
----
The converstaion was open, relaxed and without tension
----
we are all in this together 
----
He offered good advice that contributed to furthering the conversation in the right direction.
----
He knew what it was and so he informed me about it.
----
My ex always wanted to help me in situations. 
----
Cause she feels I should lock my phone.
----
He was more knowledgeable than I am so he steered the conversation
----
It's something everyone uses so i would expect they would want to know more about it
----
Because he knows that I am interested in him and wanted to talk about it. 
----
She is a very knowledgable person and keeps up to date with all of the local news
----
My friend brought up the conversation, so they seemed well-informed and interested in the topic
----
My mom just wanted something good to happen and didn't think too hard about what I was saying.
----
The team leader was the most confident and experience about of everyone. Some colleagues felt anxious — i.e., they had problems with passwords, specific concerns. Others felt confident and didn't have any questions.
----
Was just giving advice
----
Because he was also curious to know why this happened. Also, he wanted to be helpful to research why this leak happened. He was worried what he needs to change in passwords. 
----
I think the person was able to broaden their horizons through the conversation.
----
My boyfriend is not an expert about it
----
Learning new ways possiblity to get exposed 
----
We all felt the same.
----
My friend agreed with all that was discussed.
----
Indifferent
----
They seemed to be interested in what I was saying, and were excited by the virus total website. We've had so many talks about securing their tech and making good digital decisions, so they always get off the call sounding confident in their new knowledge, but unfortunately for me they always call back with a new "problem" in less than two weeks time. 
----
She was worried that they could get other information from her online accounts
----
She was worried at first but confident when we finished
----
It was something new
----
My sister is not much informed about cybersecurity so, she always pays attention when we discuss this topic.
----
Because it was a large sum of money and it was a relative of me who was scammed
----
Because he works in cybersecurity
----
they were in trouble due to the incident
----
Because she was trying to understand it thoroughly and make sure she understands everything correctly.
----
She asked me because she was interested about it and I saw that she understood what I have said
----
My girlfriend tends to be interested in IT, but she works in a completely different field.
----
She was very very worried cause she didn't want to have to pay for something
----
He think he always knows better and wants other people to think that he has knowledge about everything
----
same reasons as me, uncertainty
----
I think the other person felt this way because they were deeply concerned about their safety.
----
also interesting for others
----
My colleague is interested in cybersecurity topic and he was involved in the converstation.
----
He was concerned about the email he received, but at the same time curious about what I told him.
----
Was ashamed because she caused a problem and overall make poor decision to trust some pishing sites.
----
The colleague that called was anxious because she thought she had done something wrong and that the e-mail might be real
----
My colleague loves to chat and is interested in other people and opinions.
----
important for others too
----
My mom is interested in this topics because she want to be smart and doesn't wanna be scammed by people. But also she was anxious how many scams are out there in the world
----
for the same reason, he is iterested by the subject
----
For the same reason.
----
dont know
----
Because that was their fault
----
I believe because of the same reason as me, since he was also in the country the moment it happened. 
----
He passed the test, there wasn't anything to worry about. 
----
I felt the level of knowledge of my colleagues was lacking.
----
he was annoyed the way he spoke about his experience
----
because he started to realize that he fell victim of a scam
----
because I think it is an important topic, and in addition to empathizing with our partner
----
She appreciated the advice and made the necessary steps.
----
Worried that personal information might get leaked.
----
Because he is a kind person.
----
because it was realy interesting
----
They seemed equally as interested
----
I think she was slightly concerned about the prospects of being hacked, but felt more confident once I explained how to lower the risks
----
They wanted to learn and understand what they should do.
----
This person was not in the security role at the time but was promoted to it. Since then he has improved the position substantially.
----
they were worried as to what to do
----
Had the same feelings 
----
It was not something he was aware of
----
As the head of IT security the other person was worried that the newcomers to the company may not feel that these security issues are as important as they really are
----
They are very laid back as a person
----
She initially didnt think there was a problem but eventually came round to the fact that there was 
----
Shared concern about ethics, morals, standards, how people treat each other, widening wealth inequality...
----
She felt worried that she might lose a lot of money and her account if nothing is done about it.
----
they were interested in sharing their opinions too 
----
I think everyone on the team wants our participants to feel safe
----
My response was not a massive inconvenience to them, and I helped as much as I was able to.
----
They are experienced engineers.  
----
Because she accepted my help.
----
The conversation was two way and continued for a while
----
He understood what to do and had reassurance from me it could be fixed. 
----
Tone of conversation, we were interested and wanted to know how it had happened.
----
Same as myself re worried and annoyed. Responsible as they are part of the process 
----
He did not like that experience
----
Annoyed because of the stress/time involved; anxious in case it led to more than email being hacked.
----
She hadn't heard news but was grateful for it and offered to lock down the account temporarily to make sure it wasn't being accessed illegally. Then she said she too would be changing her passwords as soon as possible. 
----
I think my mother was proud that she was able to protect herself so well against “attacks” and was probably pleased that I praised her, as I work in this field professionally.
----
They said they were worrying about their phone but then were clearly excited about the app and wanted to share. 
----
They weren't best sure how to rectify the situation
----
She didn't know my reasoning behind me not allowing cookies.
----
Because I felt he spoke with confidence and experience. 
----
because my colleague was curious to see what i was doing
----
Probably annoyed at big corporations actions. 
----
They wanted to ensure we get all the pertinent information. 
----
They have better understanding of what might happen to them. Sometimes they tell me they've come across someting strange online and want me to verify it. They' re interested, but they're concerned about the number of scams online.
----
Because he thought the email was real
----
It was about the person who failed
----
The person was very knowledgable
----
it was obvious from the reaction
----
Because they were explaining to me their job
----
Same as me, because it is a very important topic that is not talked about enough among people
----
He studies this field
----
because they were informed
----
Because as the CEO, this kind of situations can create a lot of problems and lost of trust 
----
They don't like the idea of companies snooping
----
Maybe because he was unsure about the origin of the email he received.
----
Because he was giving me advice on cybersecurity
----
We were both very knowledgeable and informed on the topic of discussion.
----
He has trouble with identifying fake mails.
----
Knows a bit more than me about cybersecurity
----
Because we share the same thoughts and concerns
----
He's paranoid about all this stuff haha.
----
because he asked several times many things related to topic
----
This was a very friendly conversation, and there were no bad consequences, so I believe others were also calm and interested.
----
They all seemed to have some opinion about it, most of them negative. They wanted to hear everyone out, curious about their experience
----
She seemed very interested in the topic but also generally concerned about the fact that it is so difficult to assess.
----
same reasons as I, because it's a serious matter that affects all of us online
----
I this the other person was also curious about the topic and a bit anxious how easily sensitive data can be exposed.
----
She is my sister so she felt the same way. 
----
the same motivation
----
It was job related, so it made him more worried and he had to oexplain things differently for me to understand better
----
I think they were interested in the topic and thankful at the same time. 
----
The person who was involved in the discussion with me, as explained erlier, is my wife, we have a strong relationship and have generally speaking the same point of view. Moreover, we work together into the IT field and we are keen to update each other in almost everything. So we felt the same way during our dialog about this cybersecurity accident. She has the same belief as mine when it comes to improving our National infrastructures, and she thinks it's never wise to put the guard down.
----
Without me she could have fallen victim to the scam. She has no knowledge about cybersecurity.
----
because he knows all about IT
----
because he is also interested in the subject.
----
Because he was interested in this conversation.
----
Because I know the person has a similar knowledge
----
Because he had a nas too
----
Again, because her bank account could have been compromised
----
Interested about it
----
Why do you think the other person felt this way during the conversation?
----
I think similarly to myself
----
He doesn't care about anything.
----
On the one hand, because the increase in information may have led to greater self-efficacy, and on the other hand, because the issue is probably not given the same level of attention and individual measures are associated with a loss of comfort.
----
They're interested in the topic in theory but find the application to be tedious 
----
She was hacked.
----
They had all prior experience with the topic.
----
My friend was curious about how the company will react.
----
Nervous, this person was victim of cyber fraud.
----
I believe they felt the same as me since their data was stolen too
----
My sibblings have less profound knowledge on technnology
----
We both share the outlook on the situation.
----
They were concerned about threats. 
----
He wasn't exactly comfortable telling me this cause he felt ashemed.
